# FreeSO Translation
FreeSO Translation is designed to offer The Sims Online and FreeSO (or derivatives) to be avaiable in other languages and countries. This is maintained by Zack Casey and the FreeSO community. 

Object translation is not possible yet until an Edith replacement is written.

## How to Contribute
* Install The Sims Online
* Make a directory of the language you wish to translate known as [language].dir
* Copy any .cst from Online\TSOClient\gamedata\uitext\english.dir to your directory
* Translate the words between the [carets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret) from English to said language
* Push your patch to us

†On 64bit systems, this will be in Program Files(x86). **IF** you choose to install it there.

## Guidelines
* Translate everything that isn't clearly a Sims 1 concept
* Use accents instead of speciel characters.
* Latin script-based languages only. [Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) or [constructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language).
