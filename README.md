# FreeSO Translation
FreeSO Translation is designed to offer The Sims Online and FreeSO (or derivatives) to be avaiable in other languages and countries. This is maintained by Zack Casey and the FreeSO community. 

Object translation is not possible yet until an Edith replacement is written.

## How to Contribute
* Install The Sims Online ([Download here](http://largedownloads.ea.com/pub/misc/tso/))
* Fork the FSOTranslations repository
* Make a new directory of the language you wish to translate known as [language].dir
* Copy any .cst from Online\TSOClient\gamedata\uitext\english.dir to your directory as a template
* Translate the words between the [carets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret) from English to said language
* Push the patch back here

â€ On 64bit systems, this will be in Program Files(x86). **IF** you choose to install it there.

## Guidelines
* Translate everything that isn't clearly a Sims 1 concept
* Use accents instead of special characters.
* Latin script-based languages only. [Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) or [constructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language).

### Object translation
Object translation with [Volcanic](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12239448/Volcanic.pdf) is not apart of this project, at present. I'm looking into a way to incorporating this into the project.

## Seeing your changes
Put [your language].dir in the same directory as english.dir. Then change the following lines in **freeso.exe.config**:
```XML
<setting name="CurrentLang" serializeAs="String">
                <value>[your language]</value>
```
However, this is not a permanent solution. Your changes will be lost next time you update your client.
